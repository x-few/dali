Your Personal Butler.

Get something done every day and let you know.

Like `crontab` or `jenkins`, but different. Easier to use than crontab, and more focused on people than things than jenkins.

## Feature

- Execute periodic tasks.
- Send notifications to WeChat, Slack, etc.
- Synchronize files between two(or more) folders -- For data security, backup or other purposes.
- Automatically make git commits -- If you have a git repository that only needs to be submitted regularly instead of manually submitting every time.
  - Maybe we can let AI(chatGPT ...) analyze your content and automatically generate a short commit description.
- Preferably implement a software interface or web interface.
